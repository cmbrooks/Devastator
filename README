One of my biggest areas of interest is in programming microcontrollers for
embedded systems. Devastator is a robotics kit that I use to develop my
microcontroller skills. I am currently using the ROMEO BLE microcontroller
from DFRobot. The ROMEO is based on the Arduino Uno (Atmega 328p) with some
added peripherals that are designed specifically for robotics.

Using experience from CprE 288 (Embedded Systems 1) at Iowa State, I have
written the code to control the robot using AVR C, reading the Atmega 328p
datasheet and AVR C manuals to adapt my current knowledge of ARM
microcontrollers to this new platform. So far, I have explored basic GPIO,
Timers and Pulse with Modulation (PWM)Â to control the robot's motors.
